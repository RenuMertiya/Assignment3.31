Componenrs of Hadoop 2.x:
HDFS:
The default big data storage layer for hadoop is HDFS.HDFS is the “Secret Sauce” of Apache Hadoop components as users can dump huge 
datasets into HDFS and the data will sit there nicely until the user wants to leverage it for analysis. HDFS component creates several 
replicas of the data block to be distributed across different clusters for reliable and quick data access. HDFS comprises of 3 important
components-NameNode, DataNode and Secondary NameNode. HDFS operates on a Master-Slave architecture model where the NameNode acts as the 
master node for keeping a track of the storage cluster and the DataNode acts as a slave node summing up to the various systems within a 
Hadoop cluster.

YARN:
It offers improved cluster utilization and highly scalable.
Benefits of Yarn:
1) Beyond Java
2) Novel programming models and services
3) Agility
YARN forms an integral part of Hadoop 2.0.YARN is great enabler for dynamic resource utilization on Hadoop framework as users can run 
various Hadoop applications without having to bother about increasing workloads.

MapReduce:
The basic principle of operation behind MapReduce is that the “Map” job sends a query for processing to various nodes in a Hadoop cluster 
and the “Reduce” job collects all the results to output into a single value. Map Task in the Hadoop ecosystem takes input data and splits 
into independent chunks and output of this task will be the input for Reduce Task. In The same Hadoop ecosystem Reduce task combines Mapped
data tuples into smaller set of tuples. Meanwhile, both input and output of tasks are stored in a file system. MapReduce takes care of 
scheduling jobs, monitoring jobs and re-executes the failed task.
MapReduce is a Java-based system created by Google where the actual data from the HDFS store gets processed efficiently. MapReduce breaks 
down a big data processing job into smaller tasks. MapReduce is responsible for the analysing large datasets in parallel before reducing 
it to find the results. In the Hadoop ecosystem, Hadoop MapReduce is a framework based on YARN architecture. YARN based Hadoop architecture,
supports parallel processing of huge data sets and MapReduce provides the framework for easily writing applications on thousands of nodes,
considering fault and failure management.
